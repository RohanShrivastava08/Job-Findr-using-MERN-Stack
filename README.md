#### 3.2 Component Development
- Create reusable components like job cards, profile forms, and application dashboards.
- Build forms for job seekers and employers to create profiles and job listings.

#### 3.3 State Management
- Use Context API or Redux to manage global states such as user authentication and job listings.

#### 3.4 Integration with Backend
- Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the backend and handle API requests.

#### 3.5 Search and Filters

### 4. Testing

#### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components and backend functions using Jest or Mocha.

#### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between frontend components and backend API.

#### 4.3 End-to-End Testing
